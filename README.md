I've recently decided to dedicate myself to learning as much as I can about Software/Game Development.
Currently, I would love to work on my own projects for both my own personal interest as well as to build a portfolio.

- ðŸŽ® I love pretty, story-driven indie games and would love to make my own.
- ðŸ“º I'd also like to grow a Twitch and YouTube channel and do things that I love.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity, and are trying to plan out some projects.
